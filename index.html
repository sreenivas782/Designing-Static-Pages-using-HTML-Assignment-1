        <h1>Kawasaki Ninja 500</h1>
        <p>Kawasaki Ninja 500 is a bike available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. The Kawasaki Ninja 500 is powered by 451cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 44.7 bhp and a torque of 42.6 Nm.</p>
        <img src="Images/ninja-500.jpg" alt="img"/>
        <ul>
            <li>The Kawasaki Ninja 500 is the Japanese manufacturer’s latest supersport motorcycle. It sits above the Ninja 300 and the Ninja 400 and is priced exactly as much as the latter. It is available in one variant and one colour only.</li>
            <li>In terms of design, the Ninja 500 bears the new Kawasaki family look of its supersport motorcycles. Thus, it gets a sharp face with twin LED headlights, layered style fairing that sits cleanly with the fuel tank, and a raised tail section. It looks, in many respects, like a scaled-down Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R.</li>
            <li>Kawasaki has offered a decent set of features with the Ninja 500. You’ve got all-LED lights, dual-channel ABS, and an LCD display with Bluetooth connectivity.</li>
        </ul>

        </video>
        <p>The Ninja 500 is yet another fully-faired motorcycle from Kawasaki. It sits between the Ninja 400 and the Ninja 650 in the Indian market and is known for offering good performance, balance ride and also great styling. But just like other Kawasakis, the Ninja 500 is also quite expensive to maintain.

           <li>While the bike doesn’t have any direct competition, since there is no Bobber-style bike at this price point, the other 650cc option that you can look at is the Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The 2023 YZF-R3 has gone sharper and more aerodynamic. It might not be as aggressive as its bigger siblings and is closer in styling to the older-gen R1. The motorcycle comes with a full fairing with split headlamps and an air intake. Then there is the split seat setup with a short tail section.</li>
            <li>As for features, the R3 comes with a dual-channel ABS, an LCD instrument cluster and LED lighting for the headlamp and tail lamp.

            <li>The YZF-R3 is expected to be around Rs 4 lakh and will go against the Kawasaki Ninja 400. Regarding launch time, expect it to be launched around the festive season.</li>
